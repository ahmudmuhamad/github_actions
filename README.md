This repository will host the materials and code for a comprehensive course on GitHub Actions from the perspective of AI Engineers and Data Scientists.
We will explore how GitHub Actions can automate and streamline end-to-end machine learning workflows — from structuring your codebase, training models, and testing, all the way to deployment and post-deployment monitoring.

Note: The course will be delivered in Arabic.

Status: Currently in preparation — content is being actively developed.
